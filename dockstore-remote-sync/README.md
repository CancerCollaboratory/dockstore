Fetch Tools from Other GA4GH Websites
-----
### Introduction
This work allows users to type in the local database information so as to fetch data from remote website and store the data into database. Then we start the serve to provide URI API for dockstore-ui.

### Install locally
#### Configuration
- Login to posgreSQL `psql -U postgres -h localhost`
- Create user and database to store the data fetched from dockstore
  - `CREATE ROLE <username> LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>'`
  - `CREATE DATABASE <databasename> OWNER <username>`

#### Fetch data remotely and store in local database
The file remote-websites contains the list of websites we need to search

`python fetchDataFromDockstore.py -S remote-websites`

#### start the URL API server, for
`python server.py`


### Run on docker
In order to reduce the work of configuration, we can run the server on the docker. The following are steps of how to do it.
#### Get the Repository
`git clone git@github.com:spacime/dockstore_search_serve.git`
#### Build Image Based on Dockerfile
`sudo docker build -t <name of image> .`
#### Start the Created Image
`sudo docker run <name of image>`
#### Configure the Port
`sudo docker run -d -p <port of local machine>:<port of image> fetch_data_server`
