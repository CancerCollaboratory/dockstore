We've just released the next major version of Dockstore!

## Highlighted new features include:
* support for registering [checker workflows](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/publisher-tutorials/checker-workflows/), workflows that validate whether a workflow executed successfully to lead-up to the GA4GH workflow testbed
  * see a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VXdReGYXayzO7Jr-9XaLHNv6Wt46CwfvkfFDR8OEgJM/edit?usp=sharing) and our tutorial in progress at https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/wiki/WIP-Checker-Workflow-Support-Tutorial 
* launch-with [Firecloud](https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/) support, see a summary [here](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/user-tutorials/firecloud-launch-with/)
* support for the next iteration of the tool registry schema, see [v2](https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1)
* usability improvements such as the ability to link to specific versions of workflows such as [Sanger 2.0.3](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-sanger-cgp-workflow:2.0.3), search by [workflow or tool language](https://dockstore.org/search?_type=tool&descriptorType=cwl&searchMode=files), and sorting by number of stars
* user requests such as the ability to link to [unencoded workflows](https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/issues/1097) 
* documentation has been moved out to [docs.dockstore.org/](https://docs.dockstore.org/) allowing us to update it more often
* CLI
  * ability to [configure](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/publisher-tutorials/advanced-features/#alternative-cwl-launchers) Cromwell and Bunny (rabix) version or use the [generic cwl-runner interface](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/blob/master/v1.1.0-dev1/cwl-runner.cwl) to run cwl
  * ability to [POST notifications](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/user-tutorials/launch/#notifications) during workflow execution to a custom endpoint
  * ability to run unpublished tools and workflows (if you are the owner or in the organization for a tool or workflow)
* [WIP](https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/issues/1058) for displaying CWL visualizations using view.commonwl.org

## Breaking changes
### Major
Workflow IDs now take into account the source control repo that they were indexed from for example [https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/h3abionet/h3agatk](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/h3abionet/h3agatk) is the proper home of that workflow as opposed to [https://dockstore.org/workflows/h3abionet/h3agatk](https://dockstore.org/workflows/h3abionet/h3agatk) 
### Minor
* can no longer change tool or workflow name for entries that have already been created
* can no longer change descriptor type of workflows (unless in stub mode)
