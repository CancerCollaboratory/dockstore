For those not following Twitter, we're pleased (and excited!) to announce our first integration with a cloud-based genomics software platform.

Go to [Introducing Workflows, the new standard in cloud bioinformatics](https://blog.dnastack.com/introducing-workflows-the-new-standard-in-cloud-bioinformatics-787a59b1d5c6) to read more about how DNAstack makes it easier to launch and manage WDL-based workflows from both the Dockstore UI and from DNAstack directly.
