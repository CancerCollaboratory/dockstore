Ideally, all features in Dockstore would be available in all languages. 
However, due to time constraints and gaps in our knowledge of different workflows, some features of Dockstore are not available in all languages. 

To help lay out what parts of Dockstore are available in which languages, we cover the following guide for what features are available on the Dockstore site and in the Dockstore command-line utility.

<sup>[1] Some verified tools/workflows are known to execute unsuccessfully with Bunny.  As a result, these tools/workflows will also execute unsuccessfully with Bunny through Dockstore.
</sup>

<sup> [2] The handful of verified WDL tools/workflows were tested successfully.  More verification/testing likely needed.</sup>

<sup> [3] Bunny file output provisioning fails if the parameter file has "metadata" property or similar, see https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/issues/1317 </sup>
<!-- &ast; Nextflow has preliminary support for workflow registration -->
