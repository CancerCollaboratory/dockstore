# Language Support

Ideally, all features in Dockstore would be available in all languages. 
However, due to time constraints and gaps in our knowledge of different workflows, some features of Dockstore are not available in all languages. 

To help lay out what parts of Dockstore are available in which languages, we cover the following guide for what features are available on the Dockstore site and in the Dockstore command-line utility. 

{% include language-support.html %}

<sup>[0] Available in both classic and <a href="https://view.commonwl.org/">CWL Viewer</a> modes 
</sup>

<sup>[1] Does not support file-path based imports. See [FireCloud Limitations](/docs/user-tutorials/firecloud-launch-with/#limitations) for limitations.
</sup>

<sup>[2] Does not support file-path or http(s) based imports. See [DNAStack Limitations](/docs/user-tutorials/dnastack-launch-with/#limitations) for limitations.
</sup>

<sup> [3] The small number of verified Dockstore WDL tools/workflows were tested successfully.  More verification/testing likely needed.</sup>

<sup> [4] The official Nextflow CLI is not yet connected to Dockstore. However, the Nextflow CLI does have file provisioning directly baked in.</sup>
