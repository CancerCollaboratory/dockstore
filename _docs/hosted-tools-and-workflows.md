# Hosted Tools and Workflows
## Tutorial Goals
* Compare Hosted Workflows and Remote Workflows
* Register a Hosted Tool and Workflow on Dockstore

## Introduction to Hosted Tools and Workflows
A hosted tool or workflow is simply an entry where instead of files being stored in a Git repository they are stored within Dockstore. It is useful if you don't use GitHub, or if you want to take advantage of our sharing features.

**Note:** For hosted tools we do not store the Docker image in our own registry.

## Adding a Hosted Workflow
In this example we are going to add a simple one file WDL workflow to Dockstore as a hosted workflows.

## Next Steps

Find out how to launch your tools and workflows at [Launching Tools and Workflows](/docs/user-tutorials/launch/).
