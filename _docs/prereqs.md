# Developer Tutorial

An introduction to everything required to properly use Dockstore. Learn about how Docker and CWL/WDL/Nextflow are changing how scientists use and create tools via a series of tutorials which goes through the whole process of:
* Creating a tool with Docker
* Describing the tool with a descriptor file
* Creating a Dockstore account
* Registering the tool on Dockstore

The tool we will be using throughout this tutorial is [BAMStats](http://bamstats.sourceforge.net/). It is a tool for summarising Next Generation Sequencing alignments. It accepts a BAM file and produces a ZIP file containing an HTML report on the alignment.

Start this tutorial with [Getting Started With Docker](getting-started-with-docker/)
